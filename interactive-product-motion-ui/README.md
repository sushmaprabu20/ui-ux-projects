Interactive Product Showcase UI (Motion Design)

This project is a creative UI concept designed to showcase cosmetic products using interactive motion and drag-based animations. The interface focuses on visual storytelling, smooth transitions, and engaging user interactions rather than traditional static layouts.

🎨 Design Concept

The design uses bold typography, gradient backgrounds, and floating 3D elements to create a modern, high-impact product presentation. Each screen is color-themed to match the product variant, enhancing brand recognition and visual consistency.
